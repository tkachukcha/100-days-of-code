# 3/100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: September 10, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: Added computer animation and simple text with result. Still have some bugs, like everything brakes down if you click figure two times.

Things learned: 
- Learned @keyframes css animations. Simple and fun

**Thoughts:** Coding part was easy and fast, but GUI will take some time for sure

### Day 3: September 9, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: Now game is playable, although at the moment winner is announced in console. Added graphics of computer "deciding" his choice. 

Things learned: 
- Used timeouts functions by myself for the first time. Maybe can rewrite this part of code to use promises
- Found out that you cannot use array.include method to check if there's array or object inside of main array

**Thoughts:** Looks like that  my unconsious mind has been working a lot since yesterday to figure out game logic, because the solution came to my mind right after I started to code today.

### Day 2: September 8, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: Still trying to figure out game logic. Tested few things, added few useful functions/

Things learned: 
You cannot use object property "name" to find index of that object with the same name. This.name not working. But this - does!

**Thoughts:** To solve a problem sometimes you gotta stop trying to do this and do something different

### Day 1: September 7, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: I started this project month ago, but worked on it for only 4 hours, after I had working project that I had to deal with, so I postponed working on this project. 
Therefore, today I checked my code and found out that I can make it better. 
So I added few functions to shorten code, added new Class, and at the moment trying to figure out how to compare two choices of player and computer. 

Things learned: 
- how to pass function name as a string
- getting used to OOP
- mergin stash with main branch in git

**Thoughts:** I sat, started to code, and BAM, two and half hours gone in a click. Oh how I love to code!
