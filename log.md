### Day 68: December 9 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Solved yesterday's problem and now my surf forecast scraper returns forecast for number of days you passed as a variable. Getting better everyday!

### Day 67: December 8 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
At last I went away from dead point and started doing something new. Rewriting functions to get forecast not just for tomorrow, but for other days too (no more than 7 days though). Now stuck on how to push parameter value inside of puppeteer's function page.evaluate

### Day 66: December 7 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Started writing data to file day by day, appending new forecast data to data I already had

### Day 65: December 6 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Added write to file function. Thinking what to do next. Found a bug with angles on new url. Weird.

### Day 64: December 5 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Decomposed main function back to separate modules. Remember structure of my app. Now will add more functionality as I need not only forecast for tomorrow, but also for coming week too. 

**Today's thoughts**:
It's hard to come back to older code after pause. Gotta spend some time to remember what is what and who is who. 

### Day 63: November 27 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Came back to Surf Scraper. Started project almost from scratch, now I'm gonna use a webpack and use module system to compile my project. Decided to comeback to markdown output which Im started from. Bit bored by this project because to truly continue it I have to learn how to use node and mongo first, and because of all the tutorials and time I need to commit to learn them, I'm actually not working on this project. So I will finish first version and start another project, and will come back to improve functionality of this one later.

### Day 61-62: November 27-28 2021
##### Project 5: Right click menu

**Today's Progress**: 
So, I've been out for quite a few days, it's hard to comeback to streak... 

Anyway, I've participated in a Hackaton during JS course I'm learning at the moment. 
We were working as a team of 6 on a project of right click context menu with some various functions. It was a true hackaton, I've spent 16 hours of 48 hours coding. And also I was a team lead, so i had to do so much more than the others. 
During this event I've learned a lot new things about working in a team and using git with github to cooperate. Learned hard way about merging multiple branches, creating and accepting pull request and so on.

This was truly great experience.

### Day 60: November 19 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Done few nodejs tutorial and wanted to install mongodb to my localhost, but failed with weird error no one in whole internet able to resolve. Gonna try tomorrow again. 

### Day 59: November 18 2021
##### Project 4: Habit tracker

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 57: November 16 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
PLanned the project and understood that the only way to move forward is to learn nodejs and mongodb, so I started doing tutorials.  

### Day 56: November 15 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Added an array of arrays with urls needed to parse, and now my function gets an array as a parameter. Also started thinking about DB structure and made a MongoDB cluster. But it looks so complicated to me, I guess I need to do a tutorial about Mongo to start using it. 

**Thoughts**: It feels little bit owerwhelming when I'm thinking what this project is going to be. 

### Day 55: November 14 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Now html works with new scraping function. Now i gotta figure out MongoDB to use it on server with my project.
Also code went from 2 files with 310 + 80 lines to one file with 270 lines. Making it shorter and shorter!

### Day 54: November 13 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Refactored main function little bit. Added conversion of all upper case string to lowercase with first capital letter. Finish of the project is coming soon!

### Day 53: November 12 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

### Day 48: October 27 2021
##### Project 4: SurfSkate size calculator

**Today's Progress**: 
Was busy almost all day, therefore coded for only 30 minutes.

### Day 47: October 26 2021
##### Project 4: SurfSkate size calculator

**Today's Progress**: 
Today was doing small side project for my job. Calculator of surfskate sizes depending on heigth and weight of skater. it's made with two type="range" inputs, you select both parameters and  after submit you get size suggestions. Pretty easy. Now need to add images and style and deploy it. 

### Day 46: October 25 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Rewriting continued, puppeteer working a bit different than cheerio, so now Im trying to figure out how to split string with array to an actual array...

### Day 45: October 23 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Rewriting continued, was able to shorten data extraction code from one of the site from 160 to 110 lines and made it much more readable. Love, when code is clean!

### Day 44: October 21 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Started Node.JS and Mongo tutorial and continued rewriting scraping function. Made automatical creation of tides array (before it was manually written). This took me 40 minutes to solve!!!

**Things learned**: 
- How to plan an app

### Day 41: October 18 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I was thinking and planning what should I do next. 
I have plans of making the app universal, so you can input surf spot name and get a report on chosen day, or forecast for future days. 
So I was looking at my code and thinking, if I had these plans beforehand, I would have written a function with parameters for getting urls, but instead I started with just an idea and started writing code just for one surf spot. So now I wanna rewrite everything. 

**Things learned**: 
- Before making app, plan what you want it to be beforehand, with all the functionality. It will make writing code easily. 
- Now I can understand, why all the apps are constantly updating. Just by looking at your code you are getting some ideas, not only about how to make your code better and more effecient, but also about what new features you could implement.

### Day 21: September 27 2021
##### Project 3: Surf Forecast Data Scraper

**Today's Progress**: 
Went back to my code as with my friends code I was only reading documentation, but not actually coding. 
I extracted data from get request into JSON file and read it outside of the promise so now I can use this data to actually post it on web page by myself. 

**Things learned**: 
- Read and write JSON file with data. Using it in project. 

**Thoughts**:
- The main problem that this project take too long (apart I'm not working for more than 1 hour a day on it) is difficult structure of targeted web page... it's actually a pain the ass to get needed data.

### Day 9: September 15 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

**Today's Progress**: 
- Refuse to use Tailwind, seems to be confusing. Cannot understand why it's better than pure CSS. HTML looks messy and with few similar elements it takes much more time to customize same looking elements. Glad that I have only 3 of them
- Spent half an hour to trying stylize my elements with tailwind, but after I erased everything and rewrote styles with pure css. 

**Things learned**: 
- Tailwind is not easy and should be used for particular projects. Or is there anything that I'm missing?

**Link to work:** [Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock Game](https://github.com/tkachukcha/rock-lizard-spock)

### Day 3: September 9, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: Now game is playable, although at the moment winner is announced in console. Added graphics of computer "deciding" his choice. 

Things learned: 
- Used timeouts functions by myself for the first time. Maybe can rewrite this part of code to use promises
- Found out that you cannot use array.include method to check if there's array or object inside of main array

**Thoughts:** Looks like that  my unconsious mind has been working a lot since yesterday to figure out game logic, because the solution came to my mind right after I started to code today.

**Link to work:** [Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock Game](https://github.com/tkachukcha/rock-lizard-spock)


### Day 2: September 8, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: I started this project month ago, but worked on it for only 4 hours, after I had working project that I had to deal with, so I postponed working on this project. 
Therefore, today I checked my code and found out that I can make it better. 
So I added few functions to shorten code, added new Class, and at the moment trying to figure out how to compare two choices of player and computer. 

Things learned: 
- how to pass function name as a string
- getting used to OOP
- mergin stash with main branch in git

**Thoughts:** I sat, started to code, and BAM, two and half hours gone in a click. Oh how I love to code!
