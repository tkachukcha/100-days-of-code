# 13/100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: September 19 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

**Today's Progress**: 
- Made code nice and clean. Added few functions to shorten code. Changed names of functions to follow JS naming convention
- Started making analog clock
- Added dynamically generated seconds marks on clock face
- Seconds arrow is alive!

**Things learned**: 
- How to organize code
- Relearned naming conventions for functions
- Using several transform properties at once

**Thoughts**: 
- Now I can see that code is really a poetry. Mine maybe not as good as can be, but I'm trying hard :)
- More I code, more gettin into it. S O  M U C H  F U N !!!

### Day 12: September 18 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

Cheat day. Was away from home and my laptop so couldnt actually code, but I installed programming keyboard and JS code editor (SPCK - which is really nice actually, you can even use git there). From my phone I played little bit with regular expressions - yesterday watched tutorial and today tried different variations and methods. 

**Today's Progress**: 
- No progress in project. But tomorrow will give more focus and time to my project! Wanna make analog clock!

**Things learned**: 
- Started understanding regular expressions

**Thoughts**: Gotta sleep more not to oversleep mornings to code... 

### Day 11: September 17 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

**Today's Progress**: 
- am/pm mode added
- User preferences of dark and am/pm modes are now stored in localStorage and dont reset on page reload

**Things learned**: 
- Local storage usage

**Thoughts**: Finding something new everyday is so much fun. Love this challenge!

### Day 10: September 16 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

**Today's Progress**:

### Day 9: September 15 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

**Today's Progress**: 
- Refuse to use Tailwind, seems to be confusing. Cannot understand why it's better than pure CSS. HTML looks messy and with few similar elements it takes much more time to customize same looking elements. Glad that I have only 3 of them
- Spent half an hour to trying stylize my elements with tailwind, but after I erased everything and rewrote styles with pure css. 

**Things learned**: 
- Tailwind is not easy and should be used for particular projects. Or is there anything that I'm missing?

### Day 8: September 14 2021
##### Project 2: JS Clock

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added some style (need to improve)
- Added basic functionality - clocks show local time now

**Things learned**: 
- Setting up and basic use of TailwindCSS
- Working with Date object

**Thoughts:** 
- Wish I had design skill...

**Things learned**: 
- One of the ways to restrict clicking button many times
- How to use .gitgnore file

**Thoughts:**

### Day 5: September 11, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added border color changes on win or lose

### Day 4: September 10, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: 
- Added computer animation and simple text with result. Still have some bugs, like everything brakes down if you click figure two times.

**Things learned**: 
- Learned @keyframes css animations. Simple and fun

**Thoughts:** 
- Coding part was easy and fast, but GUI will take some time for sure.
- Understood, that even such a simple app can be improved, you could add new functionality, write better, more effective code, tune GUI and so on.

### Day 3: September 9, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: Now game is playable, although at the moment winner is announced in console. Added graphics of computer "deciding" his choice. 

Things learned: 
- Used timeouts functions by myself for the first time. Maybe can rewrite this part of code to use promises
- Found out that you cannot use array.include method to check if there's array or object inside of main array

**Thoughts:** Looks like that  my unconsious mind has been working a lot since yesterday to figure out game logic, because the solution came to my mind right after I started to code today.

### Day 2: September 8, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: Still trying to figure out game logic. Tested few things, added few useful functions/

Things learned: 
You cannot use object property "name" to find index of that object with the same name. This.name not working. But this - does!

**Thoughts:** To solve a problem sometimes you gotta stop trying to do this and do something different

### Day 1: September 7, 2021
##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: I started this project month ago, but worked on it for only 4 hours, after I had working project that I had to deal with, so I postponed working on this project. 
Therefore, today I checked my code and found out that I can make it better. 
So I added few functions to shorten code, added new Class, and at the moment trying to figure out how to compare two choices of player and computer. 

Things learned: 
- how to pass function name as a string
- getting used to OOP
- mergin stash with main branch in git

**Thoughts:** I sat, started to code, and BAM, two and half hours gone in a click. Oh how I love to code!
