##### Project 1: Rock Scissors Paper Lizard Spock

**Today's Progress**: I started this project month ago, but worked on it for only 4 hours, after I had working project that I had to deal with, so I postponed working on this project. 
Therefore, today I checked my code and found out that I can make it better. 
So I added few functions to shorten code, added new Class, and at the moment trying to figure out how to compare two choices of player and computer. 

Things learned: 
- how to pass function name as a string
- getting used to OOP
- mergin stash with main branch in git

**Thoughts:** I sat, started to code, and BAM, two and half hours gone in a click. Oh how I love to code!
